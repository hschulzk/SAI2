					<h2>SAI Defends Your Right to Self-Defense</h2>
					<p>
					The Second Amendment Institute's mission is to educate, activate, and empower individuals to be effectively mobilized for the second amendment.
					</p>

					<p>
					The mission of the Second Amendment Institute is accomplished by recruiting individuals with a passion for the second amendment and the Constitution. Once equipped with a firm understanding of the second amendment, these individuals are activated and empowered to effectively mobilize others for the second amendment.</p> 

					<p>
						SAI was founded in 2016 as a 501c3 non-profit organization by <span	data-toggle="modal" data-target="#tylerBio">Tyler Yzaguirre</span> and <span data-toggle="modal" data-target="#hellerBio">Dick Heller</span>.					
					</p>

					<p>
						SAI effectively mobilizes individuals for the second amendment through training, speakers, activism, and through its national student organization, <a href="http://www.s4sd.org" target="blank">Students for Self-Defense</a>.
					</p>

					<p>
						Students for Self-Defense currently includes more than 1,000 students from across the country in states such as: Delaware, New Jersey, Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, Maryland, and Pennsylvania.
